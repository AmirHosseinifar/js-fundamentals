## coercion
Change data type from one type to another. 

Type coercion means that when the operands of an operator are different types, one of them will be converted to an "equivalent" value of the other operand's type

```javascript
1 +'2'; //12

if (0 && null) ; //true

if (1 === '1') ; //false 

if (null || (4 === 1 + 3) ); // true
